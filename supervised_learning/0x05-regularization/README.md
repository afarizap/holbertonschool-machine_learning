    - What is regularization and its purpose?

        - regularization: the process of adding information in order to solve an ill-posed problem or to prevent overfitting

    - What is are L1 and L2 regularization?

        - L1 and L2 are the most common types of regularization. These update the general cost function by adding another term known as the regularization term.

    - What is the difference between the two methods?

        - L1 regularization tries to estimate the median of the data while the L2 regularization tries to estimate the mean of the data, both in order to avoid overfitting
