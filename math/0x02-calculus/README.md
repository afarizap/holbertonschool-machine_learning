## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

## General

- Summation and Product notation
    - Summation is the addition of a sequence of any kind of numbers, called addends or summands; the result is their sum or total.
    - Pi Notation, or Product Notation, is used in mathematics to indicate repeated multiplication. Pi notation provides a compact way to represent many products.

- What is a series?
    - Series in math is simply the sum of the various numbers, or elements of a sequence. 
- Common series
    - Bernoulli numbers Bn are a sequence of rational numbers
    and are used in Taylor series, Faulhaber's formula, Eurler-Maclaurin formula nad Riemann zeta function.
- What is a derivative?
    - Is a way to show instantaneous rate of change: that is, the amount by which a function is changing at one given point.

- What is the chain rule?
    - Chain rule is a formula to compute the derivative of a composite function.

- What is an indefinite integral?
    - This can be stated symbolically as F' = f The process of solving for antiderivatives is called antidifferentiation (or indefinite integration), and its opposite operation is called differentiation, which is the process of finding a derivative. 
- What is a definite integral?
    - Is the signed area of the region in the plane that is bounded by the graph of a given function between two points in the real line. Conventionally, areas above the horizontal axis of the plane are positive while areas below are negative

- What is a double integral?
    - Double integrals are a way to integrate over a two-dimensional area. Among other things, they lets us compute the volume under a surface.
