# Learning Objectives

### At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

    - What is a plot? : Is a graphical technique for representing a data set
    - What is a scatter plot? : Is a plot that display values for typically two variables for a set of data
    - What is a line graph?: Is a plot that displays information as a series of data points called 'markers' connected by straight line segments.
    - What is a bar graph?: Is a chart or graph that presents categorical data with rectangular bars with heights or lengths proportional to the values that they represent.
    - What is a histogram?: Is an approximate representation of the distribution of numerical data
    What is matplotlib?: Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
    - How to plot data with matplotlib: 

    - Approach:

    1. Import matplotlib. pyplot module for visualization.
    2. Use pandas or numpy to build a dataframe or series.
    3. Using plt.

    - How to label a plot: using xlabel or ylabel, also title and suptitle

    - How to scale an axis: using xscale or yscale and xticks, xlim, ylim.

    How to plot multiple sets of data at the same time: just plot each dataset per plt
